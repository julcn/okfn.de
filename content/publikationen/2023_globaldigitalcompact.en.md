As part of the Global Digital Compact (GDC), the United Nations is working to shape the digital future on a global scale. In May 2023, the UN Secretary-General presented a policy brief on this issue. Governments are now positioning themselves and should listen to the voices of civil society. Over the past few weeks, the Open Knowledge Foundation, as part of an alliance of civil society organizations (on the initiative of Wikimedia Germany), has taken a closer look at the policy brief and made suggestions for desirable adjustments.
