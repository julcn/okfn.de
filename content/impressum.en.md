A transfer to third countries does not take place in principle and only if it is necessary for the execution of your orders, is legally prescribed or you have given us your consent to this.

### VIII. Internet Specific Data Processing

During the use of our Internet pages, we automatically record and evaluate technical access data. For this purpose we use the tool "Matomo" (formerly "Piwik"), an open source program for web analytics, which evaluates statistical parameters for the use of our website. However, this data cannot be assigned to a specific person; the individual user remains anonymous. Further information about "Matomo" can be found on the website https://matomo.org.

This data includes, for example

- The IP address shortened by the last two octets,
- Information about the Internet browser and operating system used,
- the domain name of the website from which a visit to our Internet pages is made,
- the average length of stay in our offer, and
- the pages called in our web site.

In addition, by removing the [check mark on this site](https://traffic.okfn.de/index.php?module=CoreAdminHome&action=optOut&language=de), we can prevent Matomo from counting your visit at all. In this case, a cookie will be set to indicate to us that you have objected to its use.

Please note that the respective settings regarding cookies are only effective for your currently used device and your currently used browser. If you are using a different device or browser, you will usually have to change the settings again. We also support the "Do not Track" function of your browser. This allows you to actively tell us via your browser settings whether you wish your activities to be recorded or not. If you have activated "Do not Track", your activities will not be recorded.

The legal basis for the use of Matomo can be found in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our justified interest consists in the fact that we evaluate the use of our Website for their improvement and optimization. The data collected in this way is stored for a period of 24 months.
